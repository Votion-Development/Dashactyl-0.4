## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability, you should join our Discord server ( https://discord.gg/YZNrJ649fJ ), and DM @Two#3864 about the vulnerability.

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

I'll work on fixing the vulnerability ASAP or in a certain amount of time if possible.

Vulnerabilities should be something that would seriously damage people's client areas, like anyone being able to delete other people's servers. (which actually happened)
